          Capable and reliable Software Engineer with a massive passion for building cool applications. There are three things that make me stand out from most other developers. 
          </p>

          <p> First of all, most people who go to work do not even want to be there and are just there to make money. I ACTUALLY care and want to improve on my skills every single day.</p>
          
          <p>Secondly, I have deep understanding of developing applications. Such people are needed to be able to solve problems others can not. Also I have solid understanding of system design, particularly when it comes to writing highly intensive applications with impressive traffic and would gladly make one myself if you let me ).</p>

          <p>Finally, i have a wide range of abilities from full-stack development to DevOps and system design, which is very useful. Enjoy the rest of my portfolio!</p>
